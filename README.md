    PomoRoutine App üöÄ in progress!
</h4>

<h3 id="pre-requisitos">Pr√©-requisitos</h3>

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com).
Besides, it's good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<h3 id="objetivo">üéØ Goals</h3>

- Getting better at programming in the only way that works... by practicing
- In this project I tried to challlenge myself implementing three features: A Timer, a To Do list
and a area to make little notes.
- The implementation of the Timer was really fun, adding a new features, founding  a new bugs
and then correcting was the routine. Adding the audio feature and an option to turn it off was one of the things
that I learned in this porject. But the most hard part was to make the timer modular, the user can set for how long he wants
to study, to rest and how many sessions he wants to do.
- In the to do list the challenge was to access the elements in the task to edit the task and to remove
because I'm adding the HTML by Javascript. But the main goal was achived. I made a to do list with
a edit button, a remove button and a percentage bar to keep track of the progress.
- The Notes part was very similar to the to do list and I reused a big part of the code with
a fill adjustments.
- Besides all the difficulties, it was very challenging and fun to make a project very close to a real
product that can be used by the community. The next step is to implement an API that I'm working one
to improve and deploy the application.
